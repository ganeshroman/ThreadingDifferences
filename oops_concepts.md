## OOPs Concepts


### 1. Class
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

### 2. Object
An object is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.

### 3. Abstraction
Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object, ignoring the irrelevant details.

Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the car speed or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator, the speed is actually increasing.

### 4. Encapsulation
It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates. It is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 

- Technically, in encapsulation, the variables or the ***data in a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function*** of the class in which they are declared.
- In encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, which is similar to what data-hiding does. So, the terms `“encapsulation” and “data-hiding” are used interchangeably.`
- Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the `variables in a class as private and writing public methods` in the class to set and get the values of the variables.

### 5. Inheritance
It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. 

### 6. Polymorphism
It refers to the ability of object-oriented programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently. This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities.
